Couldn't find stuff about this in the files, but this should be meta dependency.
Note that Core(mod) isn't really a dependency in the sense that it's optional. It's active for all maps, even if no dependencies are listed (as far as I know)

Void Story(Campaign)	Core(mod)		Liberty(mod)	Liberty(Campaign)	Swarm(mod)	Swarm(Campaign)	Void(mod)	Void(Campaign)


I'm not completely sure on the order of these dependencies - but very sure that core(mod) is loaded, and then built upon by liberty(mod) and then so on..
